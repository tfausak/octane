-- | Octane's command-line entrypoint. It has three modes:
--
-- 1.  If no arguments are given, it will read from 'System.IO.stdin' and write
--     to a JSON object to 'System.IO.stdout'.
--
--     > octane < a.replay > replay.json
--
-- 2.  If one argument is given, it will assume that argument is a path to a
--     replay. Both local and remote (HTTP or HTTPS) paths are supported.
--     Octane will read from the path and write a JSON object to
--     'System.IO.stdout'.
--
--     > octane a.replay > replay.json
--
--     > octane https://media.rocketleaguereplays.com/uploads/replay_files/8D0940554D285C3F45109F85C79396A2.replay > replay.json
--
-- 3.  If multiple arguments are given, it will assume that those arguments are
--     paths to replays, read from them, and write a JSON array of objects to
--     'System.IO.stdout'.
--
--     > octane first.replay second.replay > replays.json
